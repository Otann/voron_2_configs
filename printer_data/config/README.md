# My Voron 2.4 configs

This is my backup place for my Voron 2.4 configs
Maybe I would add more explaining later, but this is mostly the stuff I picked here and there over the internet.

My most worth noting mods are:

- Tap nozzle probe - no more changing the z-offset when changing nozzled or print surfaces
- Sensorless homing, no more microswitches
- Nozzle cleaning before and after printing, so the nozzle probe is always ready
- Cancellable heatsoaking macro, you can have it for as long as you want and you still can control printer
- LED statuses for both head and chamber leds
- Filament runout sensor and filament changing macros, so manual filament change at certain layer is available (although these need some tuning)
